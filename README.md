# TDC1000 and TDC7200 for Arduino
This project is a fork of [Yveaux's original repository](https://github.com/Yveaux/TDC1000) for the TDC1000 and TDC7200 integrated circuits, which function as time-to-digital converters for precise ultrasonic signal measurement and timing applications. The library is fully functional and specifically designed for Arduino development.
I created this fork to contribute additional examples and provide more detailed explanations for users who want to better understand and apply the existing libraries.
